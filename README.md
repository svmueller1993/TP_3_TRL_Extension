Code Smells: 

The code smells we refactored were deleting a method and just adding its content to a method in a different class (only one line of code) as well as deleting four classes that are not used at all throughout our code.

User App Help and Documentation:

There is a help option in the main menu of our application, it explains to the user how to go through as a test user. The menu and application in general is very simple to understand and every function asks for what it needs from the user when it needs it. 

Code Coverage:

Using ECEmma, our code coverage is about 99.6% of our non-UI code. This was done by ensuring every outcome of every method was tested and passed.
